# arm_admittance_controller

Admittance control law to generate desired motion of an end-effector (twist), given a desired or external wrench for a robotic any velocity-controlled robot. Such a controller is necessary to use impedance-control laws and provide compliant behavior via an external force/torque sensor to velocity (or even position)-controlled robots.

The current implementation is tested on a UR10 velocity-controlled robot which is part of Robbie Yuri robot of the Interactive Robotics Group (IRG), MIT which is an older version of the [Care-O-Bot](http://www.care-o-bot.org) platform series.

**Disclaimer**: Parts of this code were adapted from [ridgeback_ur5_controller](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ridgeback_ur5_controller/tree/devel/admittance_control) from the LASA laboratory at EPFL.
